# Input fields
This includes a series of routines to read existing results and use them as
initial conditions for a new simulation.

* [input_matrix()](auxiliar_input.h) - This format reads a binary file written
    using [output_matrix()](http://basilisk.fr/src/output.h) and loads it into a
    field selected by the user. For instance, to read a square field of size
    **L0** defined inside a regular Cartesian grid with **N** points, starting
    from (**X0**,**Y0**) stored in a file "example.bin" and load it into a
    scalar field,

    ```c
        scalar T[];
        ...
        fprintf (stderr, "Reprising run from existing initial conditions ... \n");
        fprintf (stderr, "Read from example.bin ... \n");

        FILE * fp = fopen("example.bin", "r");
        if (!fp) printf("Binary file not found");
        input_matrix(T,fp,N,X0,Y0,L0);
        fclose (fp);
        ...
        boundary(T);
    ```

    An example on how to generate some arbitrary initial condition using matlab
    is available [here](test_input_matrix.c)

* [initial_condition_2Dto3D()](initial_conditions_2Dto3D.h) - This function
    reads 2D simulation results from a binary file in a format compatible with
    the gnuplot binary matrix format in double precision, see
    [auxiliar_input.h](auxiliar_input.h). The 2D results are then used to
    initialize a 3D simulation, which may be useful to reduce computational cost
    by avoiding long transients, or to focus on the development of 3D
    instabilities from a 2D base state.

* [initial_conditions_dimonte_fft2()](input_fields/initial_conditions_dimonte_fft2.h)
    This can be used to initialize an interface using an annular spectrum as in
    [Dimonte et al. (2004)](#dimonte2004).
